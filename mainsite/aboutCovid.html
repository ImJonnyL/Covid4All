                            <span class="byline">Hint: It's a virus</span> </div>
                        <p>Corona<b>virus</b> is a virus, meaning that it stores all of it's genetic information inside a membrane, and is not classified as a living being. You can think of it as as water balloon that is filled with instructions on how to make more water balloons that are filled with instructions. Coronavirus enters your body, and it hijacks your lung cells to start producing more copies of the virus. Coronavirus is dangerous because it causes the immune system to go into overdrive, killing both helpful and corrupted cells. Eventually, your immune system can get under control and purge the virus, but sometimes not before it has causes irreversible damage to your lungs. However, in severe cases, the immune system cannot handle the virus and they need to be put on ventilators to help them with their breathing. Coronavirus is also dangerous because it weakens the immune system to other diseases, such as pneumonia, which is one of the reasons why Covid patients die. Remember, wear a mask, social distance, and stay safe!</p>

                            <h2>HOW COVID SPREADS</h2></div>
                        <p>Covid spreads through contact between people or between a person and a surface that has Coronavirus on it. Scientists are still unsure about how long Coronavirus can stay on surfaces, but it is suspected that they don't last longer than 3 days on a surface or 3 minutes exposed to direct sunlight/UV rays. The esiast way to prevent yourself from catching covid, when tuching surfaces, is to not touch your face, which has many vulnerable openings for Covid viruses to infect your cells, and wash you hands for 20 seconds afterwards.</p>

                            <span class="byline">Hint: Wash your hands</span> </div>
                        <p>There are two easy ways to protect yourself from the virus. The first way is to obey yur country's guidelines, such as wearing a mask and social distancing, to decrease transmission between people. Secondly, wash your hands frequently, for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer. Both kill the virus by basically bursting the water balloon, which prevents it from hijackign your cells.</p>

                            <span class="byline">In short: follow you county's guidelines.</span> </div>
                        <p>The most concise answer is that you should find your local county's guidelines on the measures that they want you to take. But most counties have guidelines similar to this: (1)notify everyone who you could have been in contact with so that they can get tested, (2) notify the Coronavirus hotline about your infection, (3) quarantine for 14 days, and try your best to stay away from family members, (4) don't be hesitant to go to the hospital if your conditions gets worse.</p>
