                        <p>So far, in the entire world, 1.3 million people have died from Covid. Scientists do not actually know the death rate of Covid-19, but it is higher than the common flu and influenza. Certain groups are more susceptible to dying from Covid, such as the extremely young, the elder, and the already immunocompromised. We don't know the deaeth rate because we don't know how many people have gotten Covid, because some cases are extremely mild and some people are afraid of the consequences of testing positive for Covid, so they don't take the tests. Additionally, only cases that have been confirmed by a Covid test are added to the global case count and death count. If they haven't been confirmed, then we lose a data point. </p>

                        <p>Normal, surgical masks (the blue rectangular ones) have been shown to have a 65% effectiveness rate. N95 masks ahve a higher effectiveness rate, because they can stop 95% of all particles smaller than 0.3 microns, which is smaller and a Coronavirus particle. However, these should be reserved for medical professionals that need them to stay safe when tending to Covid patients. Masks are mostly effective in preventing others from getting the virus, because Coronavirus is so tiny that it hitches rides on the droplets that come out of your mouth when you exhale. Normally, without a mask, these droplets would dry out after leaving you mouth, allowing the Coronavirus particles to infect others. However, with a mask on, the droplets are trapped by the material of the mask; this is what makes that uncomfortable wet and humid feeling when you wear a mask. </p>

                        <p>When going out in the public, besides wearing a mask, you should remember to stay socially distanced from everyone else. This is because the droplets containing the Coronavirus particles can only travel so far before they fall, so staying 6 feet away from others (2 meters or the distance between your hands when your arms are stretched our) is decreases the likelihood of getting Covid. When exercising, such as biking or running, it is advised to stay mroe than 10 feet apart. </p>
