This is a user-friendly website meant to simplify Covid so anyone can understand!

We have different sites that give information about Covid such as what measures countries have taken and important numbers of Covid.

In addition, we have many Covid-themed games such as Covid Atari and a custom Covid Escape Room!

Hope you enjoy and have fun!
